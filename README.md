<h1>Smallr</h1>
<br />
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>I found that there wasn't an easy way to find small pets available for adoption rather than purchase in Ontario. Many shelters and rescues have small pets and rodents that need homes but that information isn't as easily accessible as it is for other pets.<p>
<p>As a result, I decided to make Smallr.</p>
<p>Smallr is designed to connect adoptees to adoptables in a quicker and easier way.</p>
<p>Users are able to browse pets for adoption in their area without need for an account, but shelters/rescues must create an account to be able to <strong>C</strong>reate, <strong>R</strong>ead, <strong>U</strong>pdate, or <strong>D</strong>elete.
